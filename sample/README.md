# Sample errata application

This basic application provides an HTTP API to execute a command on the host system (very secure!).

The logic is defined [here](exec/executor.go), and [here](http/server.go) is the HTTP interface. You can view the [tests](http/server_test.go) to see how the application behaves, or run it yourself with `go run main.go` which will start an HTTP server on port `8080`.

## Definitions

See the [errata.hcl file](errata.hcl) for all possible errors in this application.

## Generated Code
